Purpose of the Project: 
Dyslexic children often face challenges in reading, writing, and understanding, requiring additional attention and support, especially during their formative years. It is crucial to provide them with learning environments and activities that are both suitable and comfortable to help them grasp concepts more effectively.

Organizations like Joy With Learning are dedicated to the betterment of dyslexic children by developing educational games tailored to their needs. However, it is unclear whether these games are genuinely effective in enhancing their skills or if they are merely fun and engaging. Currently, therapists or guardians can observe a child’s emotions during gameplay to assess their impact. However, in practical scenarios, a therapist managing multiple dyslexic children cannot dedicate equal time to understanding each child’s emotional state in depth.

This is where our project, Expression Tracker, comes in. Our goal is to bridge this gap by providing a sentiment analysis report that evaluates the emotional responses of dyslexic children while they engage with educational games designed for them. By leveraging cutting-edge technology, we aim to offer therapists  , gamedevlopers  actionable insights into how these games are affecting the children emotionally, helping optimize the design and effectiveness of these activities.

Our solution not only saves time but also ensures that every child receives the personalized support they need to thrive.
